# 3D phisics vehicle

## About
This is a 3D single player student game. You control a vehicle which goes through a circuit and has to complete the map under 65 seconds!

Our game is like the prologue of Indiana Jones: Raiders Of The Lost Ark. The car being Indiana Jones and having obstacles like a giant ball pursuing you. Our vehicle is a mining trolley.

Remember that the trolley has manual transmission, so you need to change gears. See more information below.

You may need to repositionate the game window to see the statistics of the current game at the top left of the window.

The current lap record is 00:58 minutes! Will you be able to to a faster time?

Enjoy!

Some obstacles:

• Rotatory hammers (represented as cubes and spheres).

• Spikes (represented as cylinders).

• Narrow path.

• Close turns.

• Jumps.
